## Introduction to R Studio

### The R Programming Langauge

`R` is a FREE programming language / environment that is often used for statistical analysis and graphing. `R` is an amazing tool that is widely used by data scientists, researchers, and professionals from all fields. It has built-in statistical tools that help facilitate both qualitative and quantitative analysis of data. It is [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model) and helps facilitate reproducible research.  You can read more about it [here](https://www.r-project.org/about.html).

Developed in 1993 by Professors from the University of Auckland, R is one of the most commonly used programming languages for data science. Ranked at the 10th most popular programming language (see the [Tiobe Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)); R is a vital skill for most data scientists. 

On a side note, the name R comes not from a grand scheme of meaning; the two scientists who developed the language both have names that begin with R. 

### RStudio

R Studio is known as an integrated development environment (IDE), a tool that contains all resources to develop R at any level. The layout of R studio is given as follows:

You will see four panes within the R Studio window.

 + In the upper left pane we have the .Rmd file that we are working on.

 + In the upper right pane we have our current environment which includes any loaded data, variables, or functions.

 + In the lower right pane we will view plots, install packages, and get help on functions.

 + In the lower left pane we have the Console. This is where you will execute code. This also acts like a computer.
