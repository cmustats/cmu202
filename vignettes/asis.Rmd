```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(R202)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.align = "center",
  warning = FALSE,
  message = FALSE,
  echo = FALSE,
  fig.width = 7,
  height = 6
)
```

When working in an RMarkdown file, formatting can sometimes be tricky. Adding the `asis` tag within a code chunk ensures that anything in the code chunk will be displayed as text. For example, typing:

`x <- 5` 

as text will be indistinguishable from 

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, comment=""}
cat(htmltools::includeText("asis_files/asis_example.Rmd"))
```

when knitted. Note that the `x <- 5` is treated as text, not code. No variable named `x` will be created. 

In short, *asis ensures that anything in the chunk will be treated as text*.
